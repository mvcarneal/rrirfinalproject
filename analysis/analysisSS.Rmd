# Read in Data from BioTime - Single study
## this was downloaded from 'http://biotime.st-andrews.ac.uk/taxa.php?10' on 4 October 2020
## study name == 'The development of dragonfly communities and the consequences of territorial behaviour'
## study ID == ''
## BioTIME does not have an API, making this necessary
