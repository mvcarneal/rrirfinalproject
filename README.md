# Data Source

BioTIME (http://biotime.st-andrews.ac.uk/downloadArea.php)

I am looking at a multi-year dataset originally part of a study observing the establishment of dragonfly territories and territoriality (Morris, 1991). 

This is being done for Reproducible Research in R, a course being taught partially online (Youtube) and partially in-person at LSU. The recorded lectures can be found at <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGKQe3NU_VU05pjDL8QuklWRQ7N2t5e-0>

and the Github repository with lecture notes, assigned readings and assignments at

# Proposal:

Odonates are of interest to ecologists due to their mating behaviors. Male damselflies engage in sperm competition wherein a male will sometimes remove the sperm in a female's reproductive storage organ prior to placing its own sperm (Waage, 1979). Males and females are often dimorphic and brightly colored, making them possible to identify on the wing in field observations (Kalkman *et al.* 2008). Additionally, they have a global distribution, making it possible to study them in many different environments, latitudes, altitudes, etc. (Kalkman *et al.* 2008). The proposed study does not contain a behavioral aspect, as the primary investigator does not currently have any relevant data sets.

A data set from BioTIME (http://biotime.st-andrews.ac.uk/downloadArea.php), a global biodiversity database, is the source of a data set from a ~30 year study on Odonate territoriality in eastern England (Morris, 1991). This data set will be used to model the abundance changes of ten species of *Odonata* from 1959 to 1988. The objectives can be summarised as:

* Does *Odonata* abundance significantly change over the course of the study?
* Do species appear to follow different patterns of abundance changes?
* Do certain species seem to suffer upon the introduction of others?

An additional aim is to characterize species diversity and species richness. Not all species are expected to occur in equal abundances (When do they ever?), and why might we see differences between species? The data set does not contain the variables for ecological analysis, but we will attempt to answer this question within the abilities of the data set. More information is needed, including (but not limited to) predation, vegetation type and amount, scrub management, introduced species, temperature, precipitation, prey availability, pond depth, pond size. These variables are not included in the data set, but might be good as though exercises or for discussion purposes.
