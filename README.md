I am looking at a multi-year dataset describing the establishment of dragonfly territories and territoriality. 
I would like to create cleaner plots and attempt to elucidate if different species have different places
in succession of newly created ponds.

This is being done for Reproducible Research in R, a course being taught partially online (Youtube) and partially in-person at LSU. The recorded lectures can be found at <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGKQe3NU_VU05pjDL8QuklWRQ7N2t5e-0>
